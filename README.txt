How to run: 
?- ['/Users/xiaoyuwu/420/hw3/hw3.pl'].
Warning: /Users/xiaoyuwu/420/hw3/hw3.pl:21:
Singleton variable in branch: N
true.

?- path(a,b,P,C).
P = [a, c, b],
C = 13 ;
P = [a, c, d, b],
C = 16 ;
false.

Result:  the first one would be the shortest path which is P = [a, c, b], C = 13
